# Unsupervised Object Tracking

This project implements an object tracking system using rough sets and flow graphs.
It processes video input to detect and track moving object across frames.


## Features

ðŸ§  Supervised object tracking using rough set theory and flow graphs
ðŸŽ¥ Support for RGB-D video format
ðŸ“ˆ Modular architecture: separate stages for preprocessing, tracking, and postprocessing
ðŸ§ª Unit testing
ðŸ“¦ Easy setup with minimal dependency requirements

## Installation

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kKedaRr3/object_tracking.git
  cd object_tracking
  ```

## How to use?

To track objects, first load your RGB-D video in `main.py` using `load_frames_from_mp4` from the `preprocessing` module, 
then pass the loaded frames to the `object_tracking` function along with the output path, detection `threshold`, and tracking parameter `p`.

## Example results

The tracking result in video format can be found in the `results/man` folder.<br><br>
The examples below are taken from different frames.
